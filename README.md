# dokku-app-predeploy-tasks

For use with [dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku)

A common requirement with Dokku deployments is you need to run a command on a newly built container,
before an app is deployed. Common use cases include:

* Checking a database is initialised
* Running database migrations
* Any commands required to set up the server (e.g. something like a Django `collectstatic`)

## Requirements

* Dokku version `0.3.10` or higher

## Notes

Currently runs anything that isn't of proctype web, worker, urgentworker or clock

UPDATE: Similar to [dokku-logging-supervisord](https://github.com/sehrope/dokku-logging-supervisord), we now support a SCALE file, if it exists, to only run named tasks with a scale value of 0.

## Installation

On the dokku server, you need to install the plugin in the standard Dokku way. Specifically:

```
# dokku 0.4.x
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/michaelshobbs/dokku-app-predeploy-tasks.git
```
```
# dokku 0.3.x
cd /var/lib/dokku/plugins
git clone https://github.com/michaelshobbs/dokku-app-predeploy-tasks.git
dokku plugins-install
```

## Usage

In our application's Procfile, add a line of the form

```
name: cmd
```

Then in our application's SCALE file, add a line similar to

```
name=0
```

For example, for a Django application, a common requirement is to collect the static files. To do this automatically
add the following lines

Procfile:
```
static: python manage.py collectstatic
```
SCALE:
```
static=0
```

The name field is just a name you give the task. This can be any one-word name as long as the corresponding scale file entry is set to 0. If a SCALE file does not exist, we fall back to the previous functionality of blacklisting task names of 'web', 'worker', 'urgentworker' and 'clock'.

With this configuration you should on future git pushes see the output. For example, with the Django collecstatic line above,
we should see the evidence of that being run everytime we deploy.

```
$ git push dokku master

```

The commands will be run in the order that they occur in the Procfile.

Task execution will be logged by default to `/tmp/dokku-predeploy-tasks-logs`. This behavior may be overridden by setting the `DOKKU_PREDEPLOY_TASKS_LOG_DIR` environment variable for your application.

## Thanks
Thanks to [dokku-logging-supervisord](https://github.com/sehrope/dokku-logging-supervisord) for the pattern and helpers.
